# Security Policy

## Overview

The Rodent Refreshment Regulator (RRR) is a laboratory research system that requires **enterprise-grade security** to protect research data, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain system integrity in laboratory environments.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Installation Security

#### Secure Installation Pipeline
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All downloads are verified for integrity and authenticity
- **Content Scanning**: Automated detection of malicious patterns in downloaded files  
- **User Consent**: Explicit approval required for all privileged operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete installation audit trail stored in `~/.rrr_logs/security_*.log`
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic backup creation with rollback on installation failure

#### Legacy Installation Issues (RESOLVED)
**Previous insecure command:**
```bash
# INSECURE - DO NOT USE
wget -O setup_rrr.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corticomics/rodRefReg/main/setup_rrr.sh && chmod +x setup_rrr.sh && ./setup_rrr.sh
```

**Security vulnerabilities:**
- ❌ No integrity verification
- ❌ Man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability  
- ❌ Blind execution without review
- ❌ No version control or pinning
- ❌ Silent privilege escalation
- ❌ No rollback mechanism

**Current secure command:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corticomics/rodRefReg/main/verify_and_install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-tier Access Control**: Admin, Lab User, and Guest roles
- **Secure Password Storage**: Salted hash storage using cryptography library
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeouts and secure session handling
- **Hardware Access Control**: GPIO/I2C operations restricted to authenticated users

#### Data Protection
- **Database Security**: SQLite with proper access controls and backup procedures
- **Configuration Security**: Encrypted storage of sensitive settings (Slack tokens, etc.)
- **File Integrity**: Checksums for NWB files and configuration backups
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all user actions and system events

#### Network Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated against injection attacks
- **API Security**: Secure communication protocols for notifications
- **Network Isolation**: Recommended firewall rules for laboratory networks
- **Update Security**: Signed updates with verification chain

### 3. Hardware Security

#### Physical Access Controls
- **GPIO Protection**: Hardware access restricted to authorized users and groups
- **I2C Security**: Proper permission management for hardware interfaces
- **Service Isolation**: System service runs with minimal required privileges
- **Hardware Validation**: Automatic detection and validation of connected devices

## Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

### Laboratory Standards
- **IACUC/AWERB Compliance**: Complete audit trails for regulatory review
- **Data Integrity**: Verification mechanisms for research data
- **Access Logging**: Detailed records of system access and modifications
- **Backup Procedures**: Automated backup with integrity verification

### Security Monitoring
- **Activity Logging**: All user actions logged with timestamps
- **Error Tracking**: Security events and errors tracked in dedicated logs
- **System Monitoring**: Hardware and software health monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

## Security Best Practices

### For Laboratory Managers
1. **Regular Security Reviews**: Monthly review of security logs
2. **Access Management**: Regular audit of user accounts and permissions
3. **Data Backup**: Offline backup of critical research data
4. **Physical Security**: Restrict access to Raspberry Pi hardware
5. **Training**: Ensure staff understand security procedures

### For IT Administrators
1. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate laboratory systems from general networks
2. **Update Management**: Regular security updates using built-in update system
3. **Firewall Configuration**: Implement appropriate network access controls
4. **SSH Security**: Use key-based authentication for remote access
5. **Monitoring**: Implement centralized logging and monitoring

### For Users
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords and change regularly
2. **Account Security**: Log out when not using the system
3. **Physical Security**: Secure workstations and don't share credentials
4. **Report Issues**: Report any security concerns immediately
5. **Follow Procedures**: Adhere to established laboratory security protocols

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Types
- **Unauthorized Access**: Suspected unauthorized system access
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Unexpected data modifications or corruption
- **Hardware Tampering**: Physical modifications to system hardware
- **Network Intrusion**: Unauthorized network access attempts
- **Software Integrity**: Unexpected software modifications

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate affected systems from network
   - Preserve security logs and evidence
   - Document all observations and actions taken

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review security logs in `~/.rrr_logs/`
   - Check system integrity using built-in diagnostics
   - Verify hardware connections and configurations

3. **Recovery**:
   - Use automated backup and rollback capabilities
   - Restore from known-good backups if necessary
   - Implement additional monitoring as needed

4. **Reporting**:
   - Document incident details and response actions
   - Report to appropriate laboratory management
   - Update security procedures based on lessons learned

## Security Updates

### Update Mechanisms
- **Automated Updates**: Built-in secure update system with verification
- **Version Control**: All updates use cryptographically signed releases
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback if updates fail validation
- **Security Patches**: Priority delivery of security-critical updates

### Update Schedule
- **Security Updates**: Applied immediately upon availability
- **Feature Updates**: Monthly scheduled updates during maintenance windows
- **Emergency Updates**: Applied immediately for critical security issues

1. Architecture and System Design Rules
1.1 Layered Architecture Enforcement
Rule: Maintain strict separation between architectural layers
Implementation:
Use explicit imports that respect layer boundaries
No direct hardware access from business logic layer
No direct database access from presentation layer
Cursor IDE should suggest proper layer-specific imports

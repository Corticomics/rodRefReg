 State Machine Implementation

•Rule: Task execution must follow the state machine pattern

•Implementation:

•New tasks must extend the base Task class

•Custom states must inherit from the State base class

•State transitions must be explicit and documented

•Cursor IDE should verify state class inheritance and method implementation

5.1 Hardware Abstraction

•
Rule: Abstract all hardware interactions through controller classes

•
Implementation:

•
No direct hardware access outside controller classes

•
Standardized interfaces for similar hardware types

•
Mock implementations for testing

•
Cursor IDE should enforce hardware access through controllers



5.2 Device Configuration

•
Rule: Externalize all device configurations

•
Implementation:

•
Store configurations in JSON/YAML files

•
Support runtime reconfiguration where possible

•
Validate configurations against device capabilities

•
Cursor IDE should identify hardcoded device parameters



5.3 Error Detection and Recovery

•
Rule: Implement robust error detection and recovery for hardware

•
Implementation:

•
Regular status checking for critical hardware

•
Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

•
Clear error reporting with diagnostic information

•
Cursor IDE should verify hardware error handling



5.4 Resource Management

•
Rule: Properly manage hardware resources

•
Implementation:

•
Explicit connect/disconnect methods

•
Resource cleanup in error cases

•
Timeout handling for unresponsive hardware

•
Cursor IDE should verify resource cleanup



5.5 Hardware Simulation

•
Rule: Support hardware simulation for testing

•
Implementation:

•
Mock hardware interfaces with realistic behavior

•
Configuration flag to enable simulation mode

•
Simulate common failure scenarios

•
Cursor IDE should suggest test modes for hardware interfaces

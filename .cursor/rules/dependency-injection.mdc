1.5 Dependency Injection

•
Rule: Use dependency injection for service and repository dependencies

•
Implementation:

•
Pass dependencies through constructors

•
Avoid global state and singletons where possible

•
Use factory patterns for complex object creation

•
Cursor IDE should suggest constructor injection for dependencies

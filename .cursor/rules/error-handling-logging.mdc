•
Rule: Implement appropriate error recovery strategies

•
Implementation:

•
Retry with backoff for transient failures

•
Circuit breaker for recurring failures

•
Graceful degradation for non-critical components

•
Cursor IDE should verify recovery strategy implementation



7.4 User-Facing Error Messages

•
Rule: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users

•
Implementation:

•
Separate technical details from user messages

•
Include suggested actions where applicable

•
Consistent error presentation in UI

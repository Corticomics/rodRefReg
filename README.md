# Rodent Refreshment Regulator Version 17

**Last updated: 28/06/2024 by JS -- CURRENTLY A WIP**

The Rodent Refreshment Regulator (RRR) is a python-based application designed to automatically dispense precise amounts of water to laboratory mice at specified intervals. Below you will find detailed instructions on setting up, configuring, and running the system using a Raspberry Pi and up to eight stackable sixteen-relay hats from [Sequent Microsystems](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/sixteen-relays-8-layer-stackable-hat-for-raspberry-pi).

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi 4)
- 16-Relays hat from [Sequent Microsystems](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/sixteen-relays-8-layer-stackable-hat-for-raspberry-pi) (up to 8 hats depending on the scale of your setup).
- Python 3
- Required Python packages (see below)
- One 10μL micropump for each mouse enclosure. We used model "LPMX0501600B A" from [The Lee Co.](https://www.theleeco.com/products/pumps/)
- An assortment of copper wiring, tubing, and a large water reservoir (see below for details pertaining to quantity and sizing)
- (Optional) a 3D printer with PLA material for printing various support structures that may be valuable in your setup.

## Hardware Overview
1. **The Sixteen-Relays Hat:**
The RRR program sends triggers by enabling/disabling the relays atop the hat(s) on your raspberry pi. These hats are stackable depending on the number of relays required (1 relay = 1 water pump for a mouse enclosure), with each hat sporting 16 relays. Relays are sorted into pairs such that there exists one COM terminal (that supplies the power) for every two relays on the hat. As such, a finalized RRR setup using one hat for 16 enclosures would have eight power sources going into each com terminal on that hat, and a 10μL micropump wired into each of the 16 seperate relay ports. In our design, we use 12v power sources because our 10μL micropumps require 12v to trigger. Your voltage needs may differ however, so remember that the relay hats from Sequent Microsystems are designed to handle up to 24v per COM terminal.

**Note:** Due to the nature of these relays being sorted into pairs, the user-settings must be the same for each in a pair. For example, Relay pairs 1 & 2 could be configured to trigger 2 times (20μL) every 3 hours between the hours of 08:00 and 21:00, while Relay pairs 3 & 4 may have differing settings chosen. For this reason, mouse enclosures with the same water delivery needs should be wired into the same relay pair, and enclosures with differing needs should use a different relay pair (even if one of the relays in that pair must go unused).

2. **Grounding and Power Sources:**
For our system using one 16-relays hat, we used two wall adapters that each lead to eight 12v DC terminal plugs with a positive and negative port. These should be wired such that the positive terminals of each plug lead to the COM terminals on your hat, while the negative terminals should share a common ground. Furthermore, this common ground should also be connected to the grounding port on the 16-relays hat, and to the negative ports on each micropump as well. In our RRR setup illustrated below, we soldered a 1-to-24 common ground to serve this purpose.

3. **Water Reservoir and Tubing:**
A water reservoir is required to provide water to each micropump being used. We recommend using a large container (our setup uses one that is 20 Liters) because the weight of the water within will help flush excess air from the tube. Additionally, a large water reservoir will allow for less frequent refilling, which is important as an empty reservoir will cause an intake of air into the tubes leading to your pumps, which will cause higher variance in the amount of water being released into each mouse enclosure. Furthermore, we used plastic tubing with an internal diameter of 2mm, and 10μL micropumps from [The Lee Co.](https://www.theleeco.com/products/pumps/) (model "LPMX0501600B A").

**Note:** An excess number of air bubbles in your tubing will likely be present to some extent regardless of the size of your water reservoir. In testing, we found that manually priming each input tube was highly useful in eliminating excess air (i.e., connecting the micropump to its water input tube while water is flowing through it). Following this, we were able to eliminate the remaining air bubbles by running the program 200 times per pump (i.e., setting the triggers per relay pair to 200 and allowing a single interval to elapse) prior to using them for the mice. This protocol greatly reduced the variance in the quanitiy of water released by each pump per trigger.

4. **Optional 3D-Printed Support Structures:**
While not essential for a working RRR system, we designed an assortment of 3D models (available in .STL format) that assist in the following ways:
   A. A model to hold and prevent the pump from rolling in the top portion of the mouse enclosure.

   **3D Printer Settings:**
   - We used a PRUSA I3 MK3 3D printer using standard PLA Material and a 0.3mm nozzle.
   - Bed Temperature was set to 70°.
   - Nozzle temperature was set to 210°
   - Flow rate set to 115%
   - Z-offset set to 0.1405 (this value will likely be unique from printer-to-printer, and is usually calibrated during the printer's first time setup, however we are highlighting its importance here because an improper z-offset caused us a slew of           printing difficulties in the past).

## Stacking the Hats 
**Note: You may skip this section if only using one 16-relays hat**

   **RS485/MODBUS Configuration:**
   As noted in the documentation for the 16-relays hat, the hats can be configured between RS485 and MODBUS configurations. For the purposes of running the RRR program as originally written, we recommend running the MODBUS configuration. This configuration allows for direct control from the raspberry pi and communicates with the relay hats using standard MODBUS commands. Utilizing this configuration requires no changes to the existing code.
   
   However, should you be attempting to extend the functionality of the RRR's code to allow for communication with other devices with RS485 interfaces (i.e., If you wanted to integrate the RRR's relay control system into a larger RS485 network potentally spanning multiple devices), then changes to the code will be necessary according to the documentaion provided by [Sequent Microsystems](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/sixteen-relays-8-layer-stackable-hat-for-raspberry-pi).
   
   **DIP Switches:**
   Each 16-relays hat has a six position DIP switch used as a RS485 port (if applicable) and to indicate their stack level. When using a RRR setup that involves multiple hats, ensure that the dip switches for each hat are correctly set to indicate their stack level according to the diagram below from Sequent Microsystems. Please note that despite being listed as hats 1-8 in the RRR's GUI, your first hat should be set to stack level 0, your second hat should be set to 1, and so on in a 0-7 fashion.

![Dip switch diagram2](https://github.com/Corticomics/rodRefReg/assets/161750793/f99ebd3d-7b86-44a6-b370-95083e91e388)

   Additionally, it should be highlighted that your chosen hat configuration (RS485 or MODBUS) will change how these dip switches need to be setup. Sequent microsystems has detailed documentation regarding this on their [site](https://sequentmicrosystems.com/products/sixteen-relays-8-layer-stackable-hat-for-raspberry-pi), however most RRR users using a simple MODBUS configuration will simply need to set all DIP switches for TX and RX to OFF (in addition to ensuring the stack levels for each hat are set).   

   **Declaring your Number of Hats:** 
   When initially launching the RRR program, you will be prompted to input the number of hats you are using in your setup. Based on this value, your GUI will scale accordingly. Be sure that all of your hats and their respective dip switches are installed correctly prior to running the RRR program in order to avoid errors. If you declare more hats than are physically installed, the program will notify you of which hats failed to initialize, but will still load a GUI that is structured for the number of hats you declared. If errors persist, please see the troubleshooting section below.
   
## Program Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rodent-refreshment-regulator.git
   cd rodent-refreshment-regulator
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install RPi.GPIO
   pip install pillow
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Setup the Relay Hat:**
   Connect the relay hat to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins according to the relay hat documentation.

## Configuration
Before running the program, you need to configure the water dispensing intervals and time windows.

1. **Define Relay Pairs:**
   The relay pairs are predefined as follows:
   ```python
   RELAY_PAIRS = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10), (11, 12), (13, 14), (15, 16)]
   ```

2. **Set Default Values:**
   Adjust the default values for interval, stagger, and time windows in the code:
   ```python
   INTERVAL = 3600  # Default interval: 1 hour
   STAGGER = 1  # Default stagger: 1 second
   WINDOW_START = 8  # Default window start time: 8 AM
   WINDOW_END = 20  # Default window end time: 8 PM
   ```

## Running the Program
1. **Launch the GUI:**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Configure Settings via GUI:**
   - Follow the instructions provided in the welcome header.
   - Answer the questions on the right side of the screen to configure water volume and intervals.
   - Click the "Suggest Settings" button to receive setting recommendations.
   - Click the "Push Settings" button to save these settings.
   - Click "Run Program" to start the water dispensing process.
  
     **Note:** All setting changes, trigger notifications, and other alerts will be cast to the in-GUI terminal.

3. **Stop the Program:**
   - Click "Stop Program" or close the GUI window to stop the program.

## Advanced Settings
If more fine-tuned settings are desired, you may instead choose to ignore the suggest settings feature alltogether and manually change your settings within the "Advanced Settings" Section of the GUI. The parameters included in this section are:
- Enable or disable specific relay pairs
- Set the number of triggers for each relay pair
- Adjust interval and stagger times
- Define water window start and end times

## Pump Trigger Notifications (Optional)
**Method 1: Using Email**
The system can send email notifications upon successful water dispensing. We used the free-tier offered by [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/)(formerly SendInBlue) to generate a unique API key required for the RRR's emailing feature, however any equivalent service will likely be sufficient. Once you have aquired the necessary information, you may update the program's code as shown below:

1. **Configure Email Settings:**
   Update the `send_email` function with your SMTP API key and recipient details:
   ```python
   api_key = "your-smtp-api-key"
   url = "https://api.your-smtp-service.com/v3/smtp/email"
   data = {
       "sender": {"name": "MouseMaster", "email": "your-email@example.com"},
       "to": [{"email": "recipient-email@example.com"}],
       "subject": subject,
       "htmlContent": content
   }
   ```
**Method 2: Using a SlackBot**
(fill in details pertaining to slackbot functionality here!)

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Raspberry Pi and relay hat are properly connected, and that all components are grounded correctly.
- Check whether the software required for the 16-relays hat is correctly installed (available [here](https://github.com/SequentMicrosystems/16relind-rpi_\)). One indication of this being an issue is if your hat does not light up blue when the RRR program triggers.
- If your monitor flickers when the program is supposed to trigger, lowering the resolution can help.
- Verify interval and time window settings are correctly configured. Note that the interval time uses seconds, and the time window functionality uses 24-hour time.
- An initialization warning saying "failed to initialize hats" means that the RRR progam is having trouble detecting the number of hats that you have declared. Ensure that all hats are connected properly, and that you only enter the total number of hats that are currently installed on the Raspberry Pi prior to running the program.
- Review log messages in the GUI terminal for error details.
